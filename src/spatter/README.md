This document provides instructions to create a disk image needed to run spatter with gem5 and describes how to run LANL patterns

Spatter is a microbenchmark for timing Gather/Scatter kernels on CPUs and GPUs [1](https://github.com/hpcgarage/spatter/README.md)

LANL provides Spatter-compatible patterns that are representative of some workloads of interest. These
patterns are the main workloads to run in gem5

We assume the following directory structure while following the instructions in this README file:

```
spatter/
    ├── disk-image
    │   ├── build.sh                    # The script for downloading packer and building the disk image
    │   ├── shared                      # Auxiliary files for disk creation
    │   │   ├── meta-data
    │   │   ├── serial-getty@.service
    │   │   └── user-data               # If behind a proxy, set it in this file
    │   ├── spatter
    │   │   ├── gem5-init.sh            # Executes a user-provided script in simulated guest
    │   │   ├── m5-download.sh          # Script to build m5 and download the m5ops headers
    │   │   ├── m5-setup.sh             # Misc setup to boot faster and set up m5
    │   │   ├── spatter-install.sh      # Script to build spatter
    │   │   └── spatter.json            # Packer script to build the disk image
    │   └── spatter-image               # Autogenerated directory, contains the disk image after building
    ├── LICENSE                         # LANL license
    └── README.md                       # This README file
```

## Disk Image

#### NOTE: If you are behind a proxy, set it in `disk-image/shared/user-data` before building

Assuming that you are in the `src/spatter/` directory (the directory containing this README), execute the following:

```sh
cd disk-image
./build.sh          # the script downloading packer binary and building the disk image
```

Once this process succeeds, the created disk image can be found on `spatter/spatter-image/spatter`.

## Using the disk image

The disk image builds two different versions of spatter, a serial and an openmp version.

The serial version is located at `/home/gem5/spatter/spatter/build_serial_gnu/spatter`
The openmp version is located at `/home/gem5/spatter/spatter/build_omp_mpi_gnu/spatter`

The LANL patterns are located at:
```
/home/gem5/spatter/patterns/flag/static_2d/001.json
/home/gem5/spatter/patterns/flag/static_2d/001.{fp,nonfp}.json
/home/gem5/spatter/patterns/xrage/asteroid/spatter.json
/home/gem5/spatter/patterns/xrage/asteroid/spatter{1-9}.json
```
## Simulating Spatter using the sample script

This uses the sample KVM config that's provided in another git repo (link to be placed)

Assumes directory structure:
```
.
├── gem5
├── gem5-resources
└── gem5-configs
```

To build gem5:

```sh
#If you haven't downloaded gem5 yet
git clone https://github.com/gem5/gem5.git

cd gem5
# Note: The build can sometimes fail if you allocate a large -j while not
# having enough memory
scons -j$(nproc) build/X86/gem5.opt

To run a simple Spatter example that mimics Stream:

```
gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
    gem5-configs/simple-kvm-config.py \
    --image gem5-resources/src/spatter/disk-image/spatter/spatter
    --command="/home/gem5/spatter/spatter/build_serial_gnu/spatter -pUNIFORM:8:1 -l$((2**18))"
```

To run the FLAG floating-point pattern:

```
gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
    gem5-configs/simple-kvm-config.py \
    --image gem5-resources/src/spatter/disk-image/spatter/spatter
    --command="/home/gem5/spatter/spatter/build_serial_gnu/spatter --pattern=FILE=/home/gem5/spatter/patterns/flag/static_2d/001.fp.json"
```

## Using Charliecloud with gem5

LANL uses Charliecloud containers as a way to run applications in a container while
minimizing the permissions the user gets when running in a container.

To build a Charliecloud image to use gem5 with: (Dockerfile will be in same repo as the configs)
```sh
module load charliecloud
ch-image build -t gem5 --force fakeroot .
# Image is now stored as a tarball so you don't have to build it every time
ch-convert gem5 gem5.tar.gz

# To "activate" the image:
ch-convert gem5.tar.gz /var/tmp/gem5
```

Building gem5 using charliecloud:

```sh
ch-run -w -b </home/or/scratch/dir>:</home/or/scratch/dir> -c </path/to/gem5/dir> /var/tmp/gem5 -- \
    scons -j$(nproc) build/X86/gem5.opt
```

Running Spatter example using charliecloud:
```sh
# /path/to/above/dir is the path to the directory with the structure listed above
ch-run -w -b </home/or/scratch/dir>:</home/or/scratch/dir> -c </path/to/above/dir> /var/tmp/gem5 -- \
    gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
        gem5-configs/simple-kvm-config.py \
        --image gem5-resources/src/spatter/disk-image/spatter/spatter
        --command="/home/gem5/spatter/spatter/build_serial_gnu/spatter -pUNIFORM:8:1 -l$((2**18))
```
