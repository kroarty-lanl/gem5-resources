    Disk image to run [Branson](https://github.com/lanl/branson) with 3D hohlraum workload
license: BSD-3-Clause
---

This document provides instructions to create a disk image needed to run branson with gem5 and describes how to run 3D hohlraum.

Branson is a proxy application for parallel Monte Carlo transport. It contains a particle passing method for domain decomposition[1](https://github.com/lanl/branson/README.md)

The primary workload we are concerned wtih is the 3D hohlraum single node workload, which is provided in branson.

We assume the following directory structure while following the instructions in this README file:

```
branson/
    ├── disk-image
    │   ├── build.sh                    # The script for downloading packer and building the disk image
    │   ├── shared                      # Auxiliary files for disk creation
    │   │   ├── meta-data
    │   │   ├── serial-getty@.service
    │   │   └── user-data               # If behind a proxy, set it in this file
    │   ├── branson
    │   │   ├── gem5-init.sh            # Executes a user-provided script in simulated guest
    │   │   ├── m5-download.sh          # Script to build m5 and download the m5ops headers
    │   │   ├── m5-setup.sh             # Misc setup to boot faster and set up m5
    │   │   ├── branson-install.sh      # Script to build branson
    │   │   └── branson.json            # Packer script to build the disk image
    │   └── branson-image               # Autogenerated directory, contains the disk image after building
    ├── LICENSE                         # LANL license
    └── README.md                       # This README file
```

## Disk Image

#### NOTE: If you are behind a proxy, set it in `disk-image/shared/user-data` before building

Assuming that you are in the `src/branson/` directory (the directory containing this README), execute the following:

```sh
cd disk-image
./build.sh          # the script downloading packer binary and building the disk image
```

Once this process succeeds, the created disk image can be found on `branson/branson-image/branson`.

## Using the disk image

The disk image builds branson at `/home/gem5/branson/build/BRANSON`

The inputs are located in `/home/gem5/branson/inputs`
in particular we want to run `/home/gem5/branson/inputs/3D_hohlraum_single_node.xml`

```
## Simulating branson using the sample script

This uses the sample KVM config that's provided in another git repo (link to be placed)

Assumes directory structure:
```
.
├── gem5
├── gem5-resources
└── gem5-configs
```

To build gem5:

```sh
#If you haven't downloaded gem5 yet
git clone https://github.com/gem5/gem5.git

cd gem5
# Note: The build can sometimes fail if you allocate a large -j while not
# having enough memory
scons -j$(nproc) build/X86/gem5.opt
```

To run the 3D hohlraum example:

```
gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
    gem5-configs/simple-kvm-config.py \
    --image gem5-resources/src/branson/disk-image/branson/branson
    --command="/home/gem5/branson/build/BRANSON /home/gem5/branson/inputs/3D_hohlraum_single_node.xml"
```

## Using Charliecloud with gem5

LANL uses Charliecloud containers as a way to run applications in a container while
minimizing the permissions the user gets when running in a container.

To build a Charliecloud image to use gem5 with: (Dockerfile will be in same repo as the configs)
```sh
module load charliecloud
ch-image build -t gem5 --force fakeroot .
# Image is now stored as a tarball so you don't have to build it every time
ch-convert gem5 gem5.tar.gz

# To "activate" the image:
ch-convert gem5.tar.gz /var/tmp/gem5
```

Building gem5 using charliecloud:

```sh
ch-run -w -b </home/or/scratch/dir>:</home/or/scratch/dir> -c </path/to/gem5/dir> /var/tmp/gem5 -- \
    scons -j$(nproc) build/X86/gem5.opt
```

Running Spatter example using charliecloud:
```sh
# /path/to/above/dir is the path to the directory with the structure listed above
ch-run -w -b </home/or/scratch/dir>:</home/or/scratch/dir> -c </path/to/above/dir> /var/tmp/gem5 -- \
    gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
        gem5-configs/simple-kvm-config.py \
        --image gem5-resources/src/branson/disk-image/branson/branson
        --command="/home/gem5/branson/build/BRANSON /home/gem5/branson/inputs/3D_hohlraum_single_node.xml"
```
